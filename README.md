# Getting Started

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)

Our ultimate **source of truth** about everything about the project \(externally and internally\) resides **right here.** You'll be able to understand all the finer details about Helis such as what we're doing on a more granular level, learning about community initiatives and details about the token itself.

## High Level Summary

Our focus is on making **DeFi** accessible and powerful for enterprises. We're achieving this through developing a series of usable products:

1. **Payroll**: An enterprise application that enables easy payments to businesses, employees, freelancers and investors. Coupled with a beautiful interface. Fiat integration coming soon.
2. **Loans**: Enterprises have plenty of idle assets. Creating easy to use interfaces to aggregate liquidity and find the best lending rates can be integrated alongside payroll.
3. **Derivatives**: Speculation is one of the primary use cases with cryptocurrencies. Creating products that help understand the risks in a simple, easy to use way can prove to be useful. 

We plan to achieve this through the power of our entire ecosystem roadmap:
