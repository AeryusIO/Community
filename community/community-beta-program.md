# Community Beta Program

Beta testing is a crucial element of software development that is sorely overlooked within the blockchain space. Not only is beta testing essential for finding bugs, but it is also a key aspect of user-centered design. By allowing our community to test Helis, we will both catch outlying software glitches and gain valuable feedback on the first-hand experience of using our platform. This will enable our designers to further refine our interface, giving the intuitive, seamless experience that blockchain requires if it is to see mass adoption. User feedback is crucial if we are to bring distributed finance to everyone.

We will deploy working versions on test net infrastructure of our Community to validate. Each new version will incorporate improvements based on the previous round of testing and feedback. We will continue to add features and will open the process to increasing numbers of users.

The idea is to build a small, but effective and growing community so that we are able to work on multiple iterations of the product. Payouts for designated tasks will be rewarded based on complexity, priority and severity of tasks, such as, validation of functionality, focus on user-centered design and design and code bugs.
