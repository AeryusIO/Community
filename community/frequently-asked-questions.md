# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

#### Why is Helis building a product suite?

Our discussion and research has shown that asking SMEs and businesses to onboard to a decentralised payment network is akin to talking greek and latin. Our belief is that introducing them to familiar and established use-cases automated through products by is our best chance to introduce and accelerate adoption towards trust-less and decentralised ways of doing business.

Products, rather than just infrastructure or a network, will help develop a common language to make this transition towards blockchain adoption.

#### Can 3rd parties integrate into the Helis protocol/network?

Yes. The plug and play nature of the infrastructure will allow for developer communities, existing system integrators and enterprise solutions to use our protocol and network.

#### What does the Helis payment protocol achieve?

The protocol layer sits between the product layer and the network. It allows for a modular architecture and will be the only access to the network layer.

Our current protocol built on Ethereum purpose-built smart contracts enables the use cases targeted around payments, starting with, but not limited to the following:

* Utility Payments
* Subscription Payments
* Pay Per Use/Item
* Top Up

Additionally, Helis aims to make available SDKs for third parties to integrate the protocol with their own Dapps.

#### Where can I find a development roadmap?

The Helis Roadmap can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16KUn_oPkpzAX0vmOFcMBhgUYcV2jwZ2wm1Y45qK-OEI/edit?usp=sharing)

#### What is the total supply of Helis tokens?

300,000,000 \('300 million'\) Helis tokens. Fixed supply.

#### Explain how Helis tokens work?

The Helis token is a multi-utility token that will be used to govern the decentralised payment network. HELIS will have the following uses:

1. Burn
2. Bonding and Governance
3. Network Fee
4. Staking

#### Can I mine Helis tokens?

No, the total supply of the Helis tokens is fixed and there is no continuous issuance model. Helis network plans to implement a PoS \(Proof of Stake\) consensus model to ensure the security of the network. Participants on the PoS that forge transactions may be eligible for transaction fees denominated in Helis tokens as more activity is generated.

## Token / Raise

#### What will the token launch proceeds be used for?

The token launch will be distribution will be as follows:

* 16.67% Seed
* 23.33% Private
* 12% Employees & Affiliates
* 3% Advisors & Key Backers
* 10% Foundation
* 12% Ecosystem & Developer Fund
* 10% Community & Strategic Partners
* 10% Reserve
* 3% BD & Marketing

#### Will there be a lockup period for Helis tokens prior to main-net deployment?

Tokens on sale will be fully unlocked.

Seed Round and Private Round Tokens sold in the seed round will be part of a bonded contract that can be made fully liquid by transferring them to an un-bonded contract, which will be applicable to a bridge fee schedule.

#### Will there be a lockup period for tokens allocated to the founding team?

Yes. Helis tokens allocated to founders, employees and affiliates will have a lock up of 1.5 years followed by a 10% release in monthly instalments.

Advisors and Key backers will have a lock up of 1 year with 25% being released half-yearly after the 1st year.

#### How does the Bridge Fee model for token lock-ups work?

HELIS tokens purchased will be 100% unlocked upon Token Generation Event

Tokens sold in the Seed Round and Private Rounds have a 'fair price' model has put in place through the Bridge Fee mechanism where tokens from the both rounds, if liquidated, will have to cross a bridge.

The bridge fee will be on a diminishing scale starting from a certain percentage \(dependent on round\) in the first month decreasing to 0% after 9 months. This will enable ensure the token holders are incentivised to hold tokens whilst we build out the project and attain significant traction.

Tokens from the seed round and private round will be vested in a bonded contract, and any liquidity will materialise once the tokens are transferred to an un-bonded contract after paying the bridge fee.

#### Which cryptocurrencies will be accepted in the token launch?

ETH, USDC, USDT, and PAX
