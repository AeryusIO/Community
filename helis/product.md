**Products** exists as a suite of decentralised applications that are extremely easy to use for enterprises. The first flagship product is payroll, followed by loans and derivatives.

**Aggregator** layer provides a single interface and set of smart contracts to source liquidity and the best prices for enterprises to lend.

**Protocol** layer is utilised by the aggregator layer to draw upon a combination of open-source protocols for lending, exchanges, derivatives and more. Helis has also developed their own payments protocol that offers options to make flexible payments with the ability to execute different types of schedules and currencies in them. Built upon a standard framework comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries.

**Base** layer is to tap into various blockchains for their unique strengths. Ethereum is used for its programmability, Binance DEX for liquidity and Facebookâ€™s Libra for mainstream distribution.

## Payroll

Our flagship product is payroll which we started developing late last year after learning about the problem first-hand from customers. Automating processes with paying out employees, freelancers or investors is the main value add as it saves time and introduces operational efficiencies.
