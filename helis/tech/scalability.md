# Scalability

### Introduction

Many criticise Ethereum for its inability to scale. While we agree with this statement, it's important to realise the context in which scalability is required.

Typically, accessing and using financial services can take days, or weeks to use. Even if the Ethereum network is clogged and suffers from overcapacity, it still beats the existing financial systems.

However, this isn't a long term solution. In the case that the demand for Helis/DeFi products skyrockets and Ethereum hasn't scaled, we plan to roll out our own layer 2 scaling infrastructure to alleviate these pains.

### Layer 2

Currently, there exist a magnitude of layer 2 scaling solutions which can be utilised. These include state channels, plasma and side-chains. Ideally we would like to use Plasma for our layer 2 solution as it uses Ethereum as a settlement layer for security while achieving the scalability of an application specific chain. Many limitations with Plasma such as the mass-exits and non-fungibility have been solved. The next phase of research will be to introduced generalised plasma that enables state transitions to enable smart contracts to operate.

Below is a diagram of how we envision such an ecosystem to work:

### Timelines

As state above, the current scale of Ethereum marks an improvement over the legacy financial system. Should this not remain the case, we'll begin active research in development in creating our own layer 2 solution to roll out to businesses.
