* The roadmap is fluid and the order and priority of the activities on the roadmap will rely on the resources available, the customer needs and the market demand.
* Roadmap activities for Q1 2021 and beyond will be developed by Q1 2020. This will allow the project to be flexible in adopting validated open-source blockchain tech. along with a more matured view of the blockchain needs for enterprises.
