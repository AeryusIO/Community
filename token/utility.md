# Utility

Tokens enabled aligned incentives and co-ordination. However they've also been abused and become a point of contention after the run up the 2017 ICO boom. 

The HELIS token is utilised in the following ways:

1. **Burn**. A percentage of the Helis tokens collected from the network fees are burned. This will reward Helis holders as adoption grows.
2. **Network Fees**. Helis holders have control over the protocol. Helis is a self-amending network where holders will decide on upgrades and potential fixes. Tokens have to be bonded in order to vote.
3. **Bonding and Governance**. Fees will be collected as a percentage of the smart contract payments executed. Helis tokens are burned as fees as the protocol is utilised.
4. **Staking:** A percentage of the fees collected will be paid out to token holders who have token staked in a non-custodial staking contract. No node is required to run.
