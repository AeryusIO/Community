# Bonded &lt;&gt; Unbonded

**Bonded to unbonded:** There is a dynamic fee using the bridge toll model. This is primarily to prevent dumping and increase community incentivisation and participation,  adoption of the enterprise products etc.

For instance, seed investors have the option to cross the bridge with a first month fee of 55% of the tokens transferred that decreases by 20% each month over a period of 9 months. The fees will be calculated and processed by the smart contract automatically and burned by sending to a 0x0 address. While the bridge is drawn down, the burned fees will be taken out of the total supply resulting in an every decreasing total token supply.

**Unbonded to bonded:** There is a static fee of X tokens which is paid to the validator nodes within the network.

### **Price Equilibrium**

A bridge toll will be present for the first 9 months from launch. Seed investors will have to pay a bridge toll in order to trade and sell. By implementing the bridge toll model, we deter initial liquidations on exchanges as bridge fees are to be paid, especially in the early beginnings of the launch. Why is this fair? The bridge toll is offset by a lower token price given to our seed investors. An equilibrium of fairness is reached and determined by market forces.

Additionally, a price equilibrium is achieved between the seed and the private round, where by seed investors cannot abuse the price advantage. Lastly, a price floor can be achieved with the private terms and assist the project with reduced price volatility.
